    <h1>My Journey:</h1>
      <div class="journey-content">
        <p>I’ve always been an inherent creator, starting from a young age. During my years in elementary, middle school, and now high school, I’ve found that my spurs of creation are best shown through written words on a page. I quickly began to develop this skill by enveloping myself in the world of writing. I did this through my required Pre-AP English classes at my high school, registering for a public speaking course at Austin Community College in summer of 2021, SPCH- 1315-008, and as of recently, entering into a national contest known as the Eon Essay Contest on The Precipice, in summer of 2022. </p>
        <p> As a novice in the field of Content Design, I hope to mature along this path as far as my knowledge in styles of writing, thoroughly conveying my ideas, and reaching my target audience. My goal is to hone these skills as best as I can, in order for me to take the next definitive steps in my career and one day identify with the qualities of an experienced content designer. I’m grateful for any opportunity to improve and grow, and determined to reach this goal as soon as I possibly can.

          <p>I’ve always enjoyed reading. When I was younger, I loved books filled with short fables; they allowed me to enter different realities that are otherwise unattainable. Now, I indulge myself in the different worlds that lie within cover to cover, as I temporarily assume the roles of the protagonist. I’ve learned over time that it was not the academics of reading that I solely enjoyed, but the ability to reach foreign realms through new writing languages. 
          </p>
          <p> Journaling has been a significant pillar of my life for as long as I can remember. It was never something I kept up with daily, but at times when a younger me would become too consumed in my emotions, I felt I could get them out best if I wrote about them. Through this, my pencil not only became my voice for me when I couldn’t use my own, but it allowed me to find myself while familiarizing myself with my own strengths and weaknesses as a writer.
          </p>

            My love for Anime dates back to my years as a young child as well. I enjoy the moments spent with my dad, and now my younger sister too, in tackling the abstract ideals of eastern philosophy while being taken on a riveting adventure.
