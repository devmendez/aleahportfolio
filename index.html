    <h1>My Journey:</h1>
      <div class="journey-content">
        <p>I’ve always been an inherent creator, starting from a young age. During my years in elementary, middle school, and now high school, I’ve found that my spurs of creation are best shown through written words on a page. I quickly began to develop this skill through my required Pre-AP English classes at my high school, registering for a public speaking course at Austin Community College in summer of 2021, SPCH- 1315-008, and as of recently, entering into a national contest known as the Eon Essay Contest on <i>The Precipice</i>, in summer of 2022. </p>
        <p> As a novice in the field of Content Design, I hope to mature in various styles of writing, thoroughly conveying my ideas, and reaching my target audience.  My goal is to hone these skills as best as I can, in order for me to one day become an experienced Content Designer. I’m grateful for any opportunity to improve and grow, and am determined to expand my writing as soon as I possibly can.

          <p>I’ve always enjoyed reading. When I was younger, I loved books filled with short fables; they allowed me to enter  otherwise unattainable realities. Now, I indulge myself in the different worlds that lie from cover to cover, as I temporarily assume the roles of the protagonists. I’ve learned over time that it was not just the academics of reading that I enjoyed, but the ability to reach foreign realms through literature. 
          </p>
          <p> Journaling has been a significant pillar in my life for as long as I can remember. It was never something I kept up with daily, but at times when a younger me would become too consumed in my emotions, I felt I could get them out best when I wrote about them. Through this, my pencil not only became my voice for me when I couldn’t use my own, but also allowed me to learn my own strengths and weaknesses when it came to writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            My love for Anime dates back to my years as a young child as well. I enjoy the moments spent with my dad, and now my younger sister too, in tackling the abstract ideals of eastern philosophy while taking an unforgettable adventure.
